## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Responsive design using @media tags and text justification CSS options.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media (max-width: 1200px) {
    .card {
        min-width: 40%;
    }
}
@media (max-width: 800px) {
    .card {
        min-width: 80%;
    }
}
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to further explore front-end development through projects that utilize more flexbox and grid and I would like to lookk more into accessible design.
